                <div id="post-content">
                    <p>Thanks for taking the time to read my first blog post! I'm still not exactly sure what direction I'd like this site to take, but I guess that's what makes it exciting. I'm deliberately making this paragraph longer to make sure the text wraps around properly when it hits the right side of the screen...and it works, phew.</p>
                    <p>I'm completely new to web development, and I'm mostly just experimenting with HTML/CSS. I was thinking of creating separate text documents for each blog post and using Javascript to parse the files so I wouldn't have to do the HTML all over again for each blog post, but it looks like I would need to start a server in order to do that, and Github pages are all static. I will consider adding something like that later so I can play around more with backend stuff, but let me know if you have tips and tricks for that (send an email to yehe@cs.washington.edu).</p>
                    <p>I guess I'll mention that I tried making my own website about a year ago, but I deleted a few attempts because I couldn't figure out how to make it look nice. I think I spent &gt 90% of the time trying to get the navbar to look right but it kept looking like a blob or something, even with Bootstrap. So when I started this version and actually got a navbar that looked pretty cool I was really proud of myself. The moral of the story is that if you can't figure something out now, maybe come back to it a year later and you're suddenly able to do it with ease.</p>
                    <p>I've been in quarantine since the end of March, so I believe that makes it almost 5 months. I know this isn't something specific to me; everyone probably has had their own weird experiences just sitting at home sitting in front of the computer screen as the substitute for human interaction. Not being able to see my friends from school regularly made me kind of lonely, so I'm grateful that we have ways to communicate with others miles apart.</p>
                    <p>Spring quarter was really creative. I'm amazed they managed to pull an entire quarter off just online, and I guess it just shows you how far technology has come. I think most people, including myself, prefer in-person classes, however. Unfortunately, my entire fall quarter will be online as well, and it feels like each quarter that is offered remotely is another three months I lose from the once-in-a-lifetime experience that is college.</p>
                    <p>I'm also doing research at the Institute for Systems Biology this summer, which is also remote. It's strange working at a place but never once stepping foot on the campus. It's strange to think that the people that I've been working closely with the past few weeks I've never actually met in real life. Nevertheless, this has still been a super enriching learning experience for me, and it's gotten me really excited about what it's like to work in the industry. But it's a bummer (for everyone) that we won't be able to immerse ourselves in the workplace this summer.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I haven't been doing much. I was super excited to spend more time getting back into violin, but I've barely touched my instrument. The longer you spend not playing, the more your skills deteriorate, and the worse you sound, the less you want to play. Playing violin also takes a lot of time and focus, and I'm scared that investing too much time in that will make me fall behind in CS-related things.</p>
                    <p>Besides violin, I've also been going on walks around the neighborhood. I usually walk this one short loop that takes about 20 minutes to complete. During spring quarter, I only walked this loop once a week since I was busy with classes, but I think I was also just making excuses because I was lazy. Now that the weather's nicer, I go outside a walk twice a day, one loop per outing. Yesterday, I actually went out three times, since the weather was super nice. I think I'm at the point where I need to start restraining myself from going out, since it makes it hard to sit still working at home.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, it's 1AM in the morning, and I should probably get up earlier tomorrow. I hope to write to this blog more often now that I sort of have a template down. Make sure to check up every now and then for more chapter in my CS journey! Also wear a mask when you go out.</p>
