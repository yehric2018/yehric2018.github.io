                        My name is Eric (20, he/him), an incoming junior at the University of Washington majoring in computer science and minoring in neural computation and engineering. As a part of the combined BS/MS program, I will be receiving both my BS and MS degrees by 2023. Although I still have two/three years left, I've become a proficient programmer through coursework, research, and other projects.

                        This summer, I'm working at the Hood-Price Lab in the Institute for Systems Biology writing software to parse genomes for DNA sequences called transposable elements. As a biology nerd, I've tried to find biology-related applications for computer science throughout my time at UW, such as being part of Washington's iGEM team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To keep myself busy outside of classes, I've also been involved with research in UW's Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, working on a React Native app that will help create safe routes to schools, and being a TA for CSE 344, an introductory class on data management.

                        I created this website not only to polish up my web-dev skills, but also as an expressive outlet for the things I'm thinking about (that's what the blog's for). Social media isn't really the best place to be your true self, so I hope this can be a place on the Internet just for me. I encourage you to do the same. :)

                        A little more about me:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm a proud Taiwanese-American, but I can only speak English.</li>
                        <li>I have an identical twin brother who studies M.C.D Biology at UW.</li>
                        <li>My main hobby is playing violin; I've played for 11 years, but I took a quarter off so I'm currently a bit rusty.</li>
                        <li>My favorite TV show is Bojack Horseman, favorite movie is Parasite.</li>
                        <li>My favorite restaurant is Din Tai Fung.</li>
                        <li>My favorite meme is Me and the Boys.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I'd like to keep posting to the blog and trying out new things with this website, so make sure to stay tuned! It's still a work in progress, but I hope you are still impressed. Please don't hesitate to contact me, I'm always looking for new exciting opportunities. Additionally, I've learned quite a bit along my CS journey, so feel free to reach out for any advice, I'd be happy to help!
